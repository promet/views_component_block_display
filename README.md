# Views Component Block Display

Creates a views display to allow administrators to create views blocks that provide a list of row styles and exposed filters for reusable blocks.

This allows for the creation of flexible components for block layout or layout builder that can use any view mode, sort or filter but also allow the # of items, view mode and filters to be changed per block with a limited number of choices.
